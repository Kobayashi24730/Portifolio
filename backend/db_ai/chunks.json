The truth is more complicated, espe- cially in our education system, which is paid for by the students but controlled by the professoriate.

One cannot surgically remove enough material and still gracefully nav- igate the rest of one of these kitchen-sink textbooks. What is far worse is that the books are so crammed with topics that nearly all the explanation is cut out in order to keep the page count below 1100.

When you read a mystery novel, you know in advance what structure to expect: a crime, some detective work, and ﬁnally the unmasking of the evildoer.

A more powerful world-view, applying equally well to both light and matter, is pro- vided by the conservation laws, for instance the law of conservation of energy, which states that energy can never be destroyed or created but only changed from one form into another. 3 Vibrations and WavesLight is a wave.

A Note to the Student Taking Calculus Concurrently Learning calculus and physics concurrently is an excellent idea — it’s not a coincidence that the inventor of calculus, Isaac Newton, also discovered the laws of motion! If you are worried about taking these two demanding courses at the same time, let me reassure you. I think you will ﬁnd that physics helps you with calculus while cal- culus deepens and enhances your experience of physics. This book is designed to be used in either an algebra-based physics course or a calculus-based physics course that has calculus as a corequisite.

A successful theory will also make new predictions about new experiments under new conditions. Even- tually, though, it always seems to happen that a new experiment comes along, showing that under certain conditions the theory is not a good approximation or is not valid at all. The ball is then back in the theorists’ court. If an experiment disagrees with the current theory, the theory has to be changed, not the experiment.

Collecting lots of data without being able to ﬁnd any basic underlying principles is not science.

As an example of the cycle of theory and experiment, a vital step toward modern chemistry was the experimental observation that the chemical elements could not be transformed into each other, e.g., lead could not be turned into gold. This led to the theory that chemical reactions consisted of rearrangements of the elements in diﬀerent combinations, without any change in the identities of the"}, {"source": "NewtonianPhysics_104522.pdf", "text": "elements themselves.

In subsequent sections, I’ll describe two general types of limitations on prediction using the laws of physics, which were only recognized in the twentieth century.

For instance, motion is a property of all light and some matter, but it is not itself light or matter. The pressure that keeps a bicycle tire blown up is an interaction between the air and the tire. Pressure is not a form of matter in and of itself. It is as much a property of the tire as of the air.
